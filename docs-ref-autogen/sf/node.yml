  name: az sf node list
  summary: Gets the list of nodes in the Service Fabric cluster.
  langs:
  - azurecli
  parameters:
  - name: --continuation-token
    summary: The continuation token parameter is used to obtain next set of results. A continuation token with a non empty value is included in the response of the API when the results from the system do not fit in a single response. When this value is passed to the next API call, the API returns next set of results. If there are no further results then the continuation token does not contain a value. The value of this parameter should not be URL encoded.
  - name: --node-status-filter
    defaultValue: default
    summary: Allows filtering the nodes based on the NodeStatus. Only the nodes that are matching the specified filter value will be returned. The filter value can be one of the following. - default - This filter value will match all of the nodes excepts the ones with with status as Unknown or Removed. - all - This filter value will match all of the nodes. - up - This filter value will match nodes that are Up. - down - This filter value will match nodes that are Down. - enabling - This filter value will match nodes that are in the process of being enabled with status as Enabling. - disabling - This filter value will match nodes that are in the process of being disabled with status as Disabling. - disabled - This filter value will match nodes that are Disabled. - unknown - This filter value will match nodes whose status is Unknown. A node would be in Unknown state if Service Fabric does not have authoritative information about that node. This can happen if the system learns about a node at runtime. - removed - This filter value will match nodes whose status is Removed. These are the nodes that are removed from the cluster using the RemoveNodeState API. .

- uid: az_sf_node_report_health
  name: az sf node report-health
  summary: Sends a health report on the Service Fabric node.
  langs:
  - azurecli
  parameters:
  - isRequired: true
    name: --health-property
    summary: The property of the health information. An entity can have health reports for different properties. The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report. For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node, so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node. The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node. In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node. Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information.
  - isRequired: true
    name: --health-state
    summary: "Possible values include: 'Invalid', 'Ok', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Unknown'."
  - isRequired: true
    name: --node-name
    summary: The name of the node.
  - isRequired: true
    name: --source-id
    summary: The source name which identifies the client/watchdog/system component which generated the health information.
  - name: --description
    summary: The description of the health information. It represents free text used to add human readable information about the report. The maximum string length for the description is 4096 characters. If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated. When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters. The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred. Note that when truncated, the description has less than 4096 characters from the original string.
  - name: --remove-when-expired
    summary: Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store when it expires. If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it expires. If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default. When clients report periodically, they should set this value to false (default). This way, is the reporter has issues (eg. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires. This flags the entity as being in Error health state.
  - name: --sequence-number
    summary: The sequence number for this health report as a numeric string. The report sequence number is used by the health store to detect stale reports. If not specified, a sequence number is auto-generated by the health client when a report is added.
  - name: --timeout -t
    defaultValue: "60"
    summary: The server timeout for performing the operation, specified in seconds. This is the maximum time a client can wait.
  - name: --ttl
    summary: The duration, in milliseconds, for which this health report is valid. When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live. If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value.
