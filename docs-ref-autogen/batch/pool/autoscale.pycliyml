  - name: –auto-scale-evaluation-interval
    isRequired: False
    summary: The time interval at which to automatically adjust the pool size according to the autoscale formula. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). If you specify a new interval, then the existing autoscale evaluation schedule will be stopped and a new autoscale evaluation schedule will be started, with its starting time being the time when this request was issued.

    summary: The formula for the desired number of compute nodes in the pool. The formula is checked for validity before it is applied to the pool.
