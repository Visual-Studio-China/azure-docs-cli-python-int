  - name: –on-all-tasks-complete
    isRequired: False
    summary: The action the Batch service should take when all tasks in the job are in the completed state. If omitted, the completion behavior is left unchanged. You may not change the value from terminateJob to noAction - that is, once you have engaged automatic job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the request fails with an ‘invalid property value’ error response; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
    description: ''
    parameterValueGroup: noAction, terminateJob
  - name: –priority
    isRequired: False
    summary: The priority of the job. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. If omitted, the priority of the job is left unchanged.
    description: ''
  - name: –job-max-task-retry-count
    isRequired: False
    summary: The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
    description: ''
  - name: –job-max-wall-clock-time
    isRequired: False
    summary: The maximum elapsed time that the job may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run. Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
    description: ''
  - name: –pool-id
