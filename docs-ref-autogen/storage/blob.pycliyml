If it is not, it will download the remaining data parallel using the number of threads equal to max_connections. Each chunk will be of size self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE. If set to 1, a single large get request will be done. This is not generally recommended but available if very few threads should be used, network requests are very expensive, or a non-seekable stream prevents parallel download. This may also be useful if many blobs are expected to be empty as an extra request is required for empty blobs if max_connections is greater than 1.

    isRequired: False
    summary: If set to true, validates an MD5 hash for each retrieved portion of the blob. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will already validate. Note that the service will only return transactional MD5s for chunks 4MB or less so the first get request will be of size self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE instead of self.MAX_SINGLE_GET_SIZE. If self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE was set to greater than 4MB an error will be thrown. As computing the MD5 takes processing time and more requests will need to be done due to the reduced chunk size there may be some increase in latency.
