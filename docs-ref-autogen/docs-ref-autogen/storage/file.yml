- uid: az_storage_file_download
  name: az storage file download
  summary: Downloads a file to a file path, with automatic chunking and progress notifications.
  langs:
  - azurecli
  parameters:
  - isRequired: true
    name: --path -p
    summary: The path to the file within the file share.
  - isRequired: true
    name: --share-name -s
    summary: The file share name.
  - name: --dest
    summary: Path of the file to write to. The source filename will be used if not specified.
  - name: --end-range
    summary: 'End of byte range to use for downloading a section of the file. If end_range is given, start_range must be provided. The start_range and end_range params are inclusive. Ex: start_range=0, end_range=511 will download first 512 bytes of file.'
  - name: --max-connections
    defaultValue: "2"
    summary: If set to 2 or greater, an initial get will be done for the first self.MAX_SINGLE_GET_SIZE bytes of the file. If this is the entire file, the method returns at this point. If it is not, it will download the remaining data parallel using the number of threads equal to max_connections. Each chunk will be of size self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE. If set to 1, a single large get request will be done. This is not generally recommended but available if very few threads should be used, network requests are very expensive, or a non-seekable stream prevents parallel download. This may also be valuable if the file is being concurrently modified to enforce atomicity or if many files are expected to be empty as an extra request is required for empty files if max_connections is greater than 1.
  - name: --open-mode
    defaultValue: wb
    summary: Mode to use when opening the file. Note that specifying append only open_mode prevents parallel download. So, max_connections must be set to 1 if this open_mode is used.
  - name: --start-range
    summary: 'Start of byte range to use for downloading a section of the file. If no end_range is given, all bytes after the start_range will be downloaded. The start_range and end_range params are inclusive. Ex: start_range=0, end_range=511 will download first 512 bytes of file.'
  - name: --timeout
    summary: Request timeout in seconds. Applies to each call to the service.
  - name: --validate-content
    summary: If set to true, validates an MD5 hash for each retrieved portion of the file. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will already validate. Note that the service will only return transactional MD5s for chunks 4MB or less so the first get request will be of size self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE instead of self.MAX_SINGLE_GET_SIZE. If self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE was set to greater than 4MB an error will be thrown. As computing the MD5 takes processing time and more requests will need to be done due to the reduced chunk size there may be some increase in latency.
