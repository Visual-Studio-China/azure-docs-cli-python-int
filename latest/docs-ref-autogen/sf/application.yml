  name: az sf application delete
  summary: Deletes an existing Service Fabric application.
  description: Deletes an existing Service Fabric application. An application must be created before it can be deleted. Deleting an application will delete all services that are part of that application. By default Service Fabric will try to close service replicas in a graceful manner and then delete the service. However if service is having issues closing the replica gracefully, the delete operation may take a long time or get stuck. Use the optional ForceRemove flag to skip the graceful close sequence and forcefully delete the application and all of the its services.

  name: az sf application report-health
  summary: Sends a health report on the Service Fabric application.
  description: Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric application. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, check that the report appears in the events section.

  - isRequired: true
    name: --health-property
    summary: The property of the health information. An entity can have health reports for different properties. The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report. For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node, so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node. The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node. In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node. Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information.

    description: ''
  - name: --description
    summary: The description of the health information. It represents free text used to add human readable information about the report. The maximum string length for the description is 4096 characters. If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated. When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters. The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred. Note that when truncated, the description has less than 4096 characters from the original string.
    description: ''
  - name: --remove-when-expired
    summary: Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store when it expires. If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it expires. If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default. When clients report periodically, they should set this value to false (default). This way, is the reporter has issues (eg. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires. This flags the entity as being in Error health state.
    description: ''
  - name: --sequence-number
    summary: The sequence number for this health report as a numeric string. The report sequence number is used by the health store to detect stale reports. If not specified, a sequence number is auto-generated by the health client when a report is added.

    defaultValue: "60"
    summary: The server timeout for performing the operation, specified in seconds. This is the maximum time a client can wait.
    description: ''
  - name: --ttl
    summary: The duration, in milliseconds, for which this health report is valid. When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live. If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value.

- uid: az_sf_application_type
  name: az sf application type
  summary: Gets the list of application types in the Service Fabric cluster.
  description: Returns the information about the application types that are provisioned or in the process of being provisioned in the Service Fabric cluster. Each version of an application type is returned as one application type. The response includes the name, version, status and other details about the application type. This is a paged query, meaning that if not all of the application types fit in a page, one page of results is returned as well as a continuation token which can be used to get the next page. For example, if there are 10 application types but a page only fits the first 3 application types, or if max results is set to 3, then 3 is returned. To access the rest of the results, retrieve subsequent pages by using the returned continuation token in the next query. An empty continuation token is returned if there are no subsequent pages.
  langs:
  - azurecli
  parameters:
  - name: --continuation-token
    summary: The continuation token parameter is used to obtain next set of results. A continuation token with a non empty value is included in the response of the API when the results from the system do not fit in a single response. When this value is passed to the next API call, the API returns next set of results. If there are no further results then the continuation token does not contain a value. The value of this parameter should not be URL encoded.

    summary: The flag that specifies whether application parameters will be excluded from the result.
    description: ''
  - name: --max-results
    summary: The maximum number of results to be returned as part of the paged queries. This parameter defines the upper bound on the number of results returned. The results returned can be less than the specified maximum results if they do not fit in the message as per the max message size restrictions defined in the configuration. If this parameter is zero or not specified, the paged queries includes as much results as possible that fit in the return message.
