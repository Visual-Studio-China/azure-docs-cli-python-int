- uid: az_storage_container_lease_break
  name: az storage container lease break
  summary: Break the lease, if the container has an active lease.
  langs:
  - azurecli
  parameters:
  - isRequired: true
    name: --container-name -c
    summary: The container name.
  - name: --lease-break-period
    summary: This is the proposed duration of seconds that the lease should continue before it is broken, between 0 and 60 seconds. This break period is only used if it is shorter than the time remaining on the lease. If longer, the time remaining on the lease is used. A new lease will not be available before the break period has expired, but the lease may be held for longer than the break period. If this header does not appear with a break operation, a fixed-duration lease breaks after the remaining lease period elapses, and an infinite lease breaks immediately.
